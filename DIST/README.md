# NagBot
SD&amp;D project

Here you can download the latest build. Download the entire folder (currently "NagBot_v1") and run the NagBot.exe to run the app. Note that the app will take a few seconds to lauch (a debug cmd line will also launch since we are still in beta) and also a few seconds to close (it will need to check all data is saved)

**UI Flowchart (UI may differ a bit since we are still in beta)**
