# NagBot
SD&amp;D project

Here you can download the latest build. Download the entire folder (currently "NagBot_v1") and run the NagBot.exe to run the app. Note that the app will take a few seconds to lauch (a debug cmd line will also launch since we are still in beta) and also a few seconds to close (it will need to check all data is saved)

## When using the Denylist

**Note:** when adding keywords to a denylist, realize we look at the Title of the active screen, not the URL. So "youtube" will work but don't put .com or stuff specific to the URL. In Chrome if you hover over the Tab the title
will appear. This is what we check against. Similarly for most apps it will be what appears at the top (upper left) of the window.

**UI Flowchart (UI may differ a bit since we are still in beta)**
